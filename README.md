What?
============
Harvest is a C# library for web-crawling. With a lightweight and flexible architecture, it makes common crawling tasks easy.

The API is minimal, and you can control pretty much everything.

That's it?

Yep, for now. Note that Harvest is pretty much a work in progress, but it's already used in production to do some cool things.
